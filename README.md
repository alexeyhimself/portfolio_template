## For whom
This template might be a good solution for you if you:
* don't have a portfolio, 
* want to build a portfolio from a simple and nice template fast,
* know how to work with GitHub and JSON.

This portfolio uses [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) technology for publishing. And for example [this portfolio template is currently published with GitHub Pages](https://alexeyhimself.github.io/portfolio_template) as well.

Inspiration for simple and clear design for this template I've got from [Nathan Ko](https://nathanko.com)'s portfolio web-site.
